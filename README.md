# discord_always_online
Keeps the online status of discord profile online (green icon)

Use with uptimerobot and replit to automate the script.
If the code stops (e.g. you changed your discord password which requires you to update the auth key), an error message is sent to a notification channel in discord via discord webhook/bot.
